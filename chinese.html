Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
 flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
 (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, 
 traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is 
 known as a pizzaiolo.
