Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various 
other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is
 then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is 
 sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    Pastry refers to a variety of doughs, as well as the sweet and savoury baked goods made from them. 
    These goods are often called pastries as a synecdoche, and the dough may be accordingly called pastry
     dough for clarity. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery
